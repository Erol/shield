# Shield

Shield

_n. A solid piece of metal code used to protect your application._

## Why another authentication library?

1. Because most of the other libraries are too huge.
2. Extending other libraries is a pain.
3. Writing code is fun :-)

## Description of Shield

1. Simple
2. Doesn't get in the way
3. Extensible (see [shield-contrib][shield-contrib]).

## Getting started

The fastest way to get started is by using one of the drop-in solutions
in [shield-contrib][shield-contrib].

I've also written a [quick and short example][sin-ohm] of using it with
[Ohm][ohm] and [Sinatra][sin] if you want to understand it a bit more.
